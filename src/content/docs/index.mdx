## The open protocol for structured, agent-readable web content

SDF (Structured Data Format) is a JSON-based protocol that eliminates redundant extraction work across AI agents. Instead of every agent independently parsing raw HTML, publishers convert once and agents consume a canonical, schema-validated representation.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Schema-Validated" icon="approve-check">
    Every SDF document validates against JSON Schema (draft 2020-12). Structural guarantees mean agents skip parsing heuristics entirely.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Type-Aware" icon="list-format">
    10 parent types, 50+ subtypes. Articles, commerce, code, events, discussions — each with type-specific structured fields that agents can query directly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cacheable" icon="rocket">
    Content hashing via `content_hash` enables deduplication and cache validation. Agents skip re-processing when content has not changed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Provenance" icon="information">
    Full audit trail: converter identity, model used, processing chain, confidence scores. Consumers know exactly how the document was produced.

## Why not just use HTML?

A typical web page is **89 KB** of HTML — ads, nav, scripts, boilerplate. That becomes **~73,000 tokens** for an LLM to process. The same content in SDF is **~750 tokens**: pre-extracted entities, claims, relationships, and type-specific structured data.

SDF is the **compilation layer** between web content and AI agents.
