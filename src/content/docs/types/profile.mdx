## Notes

- `entity_name` is the canonical name, which may differ from the page title. Use the most common and recognizable form.
- `entity_type` mirrors the subtype but is explicit in the type_data for ease of consumption.
- `bio` is a concise summary, not the full profile text. The complete content is in `sections`.
- `affiliations` lists current affiliations. Historical affiliations should be captured in `sections` or `entities`.
- `social_links` captures links found on the profile page. The `platform` field is normalized to lowercase identifiers.
- For organizational profiles with product listings, use `aspects: ["commerce.product"]` if the page also functions as a product page.
