## Overview

The `discussion` parent type covers community-generated content including forums, Q&A platforms, comment threads, review threads, and polls. This type captures the conversational structure and resolution state that agents need for question-answering tasks.

## Subtypes

| Subtype | Qualified Type | Description |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| `forum` | `discussion.forum` | Forum thread or discussion |
| `qa` | `discussion.qa` | Question-and-answer format (e.g., Stack Overflow) |
| `comment_thread` | `discussion.comment_thread` | Comment thread on an article or post |
| `review_thread` | `discussion.review_thread` | User review collection |
| `poll` | `discussion.poll` | Poll or survey with results |

## type_data fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `question_title` | `string` | Yes | Title of the question or discussion topic |
| `answer_count` | `integer` | No | Number of answers or replies |
| `accepted_answer` | `string` | No | Text of the accepted or best answer |
| `votes` | `integer` | No | Vote count (upvotes minus downvotes) |
| `tags` | `array<string>` | No | Topic tags applied to the discussion |
| `is_resolved` | `boolean` | No | Whether the question or issue is resolved |

## Example type_data

<Code code={`{
  "type_data": {
    "question_title": "How to handle concurrent database migrations in a distributed system?",
    "answer_count": 7,
    "accepted_answer": "Use advisory locks at the migration runner level. Each instance attempts to acquire a PostgreSQL advisory lock before running migrations. Only the instance that holds the lock proceeds; others wait or skip. This ensures exactly-once execution without requiring external coordination.",
    "votes": 142,
    "tags": ["postgresql", "distributed-systems", "database-migrations", "concurrency"],
    "is_resolved": true
  }
}`} lang="json" title="discussion type_data" />

## Notes

- `question_title` is the thread title or question, not a summary. Use `summary.one_line` for a generated summary.
- `accepted_answer` contains the text of the accepted answer, not the full answer object. The full answer structure is in `sections`.
- `votes` is a net score (upvotes minus downvotes). Negative values are valid.
- `is_resolved` indicates whether the original question has been answered to the asker's satisfaction. For forums without explicit resolution, this field may be omitted.
- `tags` are the platform-native tags, not SDF-generated topics. Use `topics` for SDF-classified topics.
- For Q&A content that also serves as documentation (e.g., canonical Stack Overflow answers), use `aspects: ["documentation.faq"]`.
