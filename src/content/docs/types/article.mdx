## Example type_data

<Code code={`{
  "type_data": {
    "authors": ["Maria Schmidt", "James Chen"],
    "byline": "Maria Schmidt and James Chen, Technology Desk",
    "publish_date": "2025-03-15",
    "section": "Technology",
    "word_count": 2847,
    "reading_time": 12,
    "sources": [
      "EU Parliament records",
      "Press conference transcript",
      "Industry analyst interviews"
    ],
    "corrections": [
      {
        "date": "2025-03-16",
        "description": "Corrected the implementation timeline from 12 to 18 months"
      }
    ]
  }
}`} lang="json" title="article type_data" />

## Corrections schema

When an article has been corrected after publication, the `corrections` array records each correction:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `date` | `string` (ISO 8601 date) | Date the correction was made |
| `description` | `string` | Description of what was corrected |

## Notes

- The `authors` field should contain individual author names, not organizational bylines. Use `byline` for the full displayed attribution.
- `publish_date` is the original publication date, not the SDF conversion date. Use `provenance.conversion_timestamp` for conversion timing.
- `reading_time` is calculated at approximately 238 words per minute.
- For reviews that also have commerce aspects (e.g., product reviews with pricing), use `aspects: ["commerce.product"]` on the document.
