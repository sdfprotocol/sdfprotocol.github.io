## What an agent receives

Instead of parsing 89 KB of raw HTML, an AI agent receives a structured JSON document like this. The example below represents a news article — approximately **750 tokens** compared to **~73,000 tokens** for the original HTML.

## Anatomy of an SDF document

### `source`
Origin metadata: the URL, domain, fetch timestamp, HTTP status, and content language. Agents know exactly where this content came from and when it was retrieved.

### `summary`
Three levels of summarization: a one-line headline, key bullet points, and a paragraph-length abstract. Agents select the appropriate level of detail for their use case.

### `entities`
Named entities extracted from the content with type classification, role assignment, and salience scoring. Agents get a structured entity graph without running NER.

### `claims`
Factual assertions extracted from the content with source attribution and confidence scores. Agents can verify claims against supporting entities without re-reading the source text.

### `relationships`
Subject-predicate-object triples expressing relationships between entities. Agents consume a knowledge graph fragment directly.

### `type_data`
Type-specific fields determined by the `parent_type` and `type`. An `article.news` document includes authors, publish date, section, and word count. A `commerce.product` document would include price, availability, and specifications instead.

### `provenance`
Full audit trail: which converter produced this document, which model was used, when the conversion happened, the confidence score, and a content hash for deduplication.

## Token efficiency

| Representation | Size | Tokens (approx.) | Reduction |
|---------------|------|-------------------|-----------|
| Raw HTML | 89 KB | ~73,000 | — |
| Markdown (cleaned) | 12 KB | ~4,200 | 94% |
| **SDF JSON** | **2 KB** | **~750** | **99%** |

The SDF representation preserves the semantic content — entities, claims, relationships, type-specific fields — while eliminating everything an agent does not need: layout markup, navigation, advertising, scripts, and boilerplate.

This is what agents should receive instead of raw HTML.
