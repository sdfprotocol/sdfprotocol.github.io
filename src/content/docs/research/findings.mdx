## Production deployment

SDF has been validated in a production deployment across 2,335 documents spanning all 10 parent types and 74 unique type combinations. The results below summarize pipeline performance, extraction accuracy, and token efficiency.

## Summary statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total documents processed | 2,335 |
| Parent types covered | 10 (all) |
| Unique type combinations | 74 |
| JSON validity rate | 100% |
| Schema validation pass rate | 100% |
| Average extraction confidence | 0.91 |
| Average processing time | ~400 ms/document |

## Pipeline architecture

The SDF conversion pipeline uses a two-stage model cascade:

| Stage | Model | Parameters | Purpose |
|-------|-------|-----------|---------|
| Classification | sdf-classifier | 1.5B | Determine parent_type and type |
| Extraction | sdf-extractor | 3B | Extract all document fields |

This specialized cascade is **4.1x faster** than a monolithic 14B parameter baseline that performs both classification and extraction in a single pass.

| Approach | Parameters | Speed | Accuracy |
|----------|-----------|-------|----------|
| Monolithic baseline | 14B | 1.0x | 87% |
| **SDF cascade** | **1.5B + 3B** | **4.1x** | **90%** |

The smaller, specialized models outperform the larger generalist model on both speed and accuracy because:

1. The classifier is optimized for a constrained output space (10 parent types, 50+ subtypes)
2. The extractor receives the type classification as input, narrowing its extraction schema
3. Each model is fine-tuned on its specific task rather than trained on the joint task

## Extraction accuracy

Overall extraction accuracy: **90% exact match** across all field types.

| Field Category | Exact Match | Notes |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Type classification | 95.2% | After normalization cascade |
| Entity extraction | 91.3% | Name + type + salience |
| Claim extraction | 87.6% | Claim text + confidence |
| Relationship extraction | 85.4% | Subject + predicate + object |
| Summary generation | 92.1% | Evaluated by human raters |
| type_data fields | 89.8% | Type-specific structured fields |

## Type normalization

The 5-stage type normalization cascade corrected 63 non-standard type inventions across the 2,335 document corpus:

| Normalization Stage | Corrections | Example |
|--------------------|-------------|---------|
| Exact match | 0 (pass-through) | `article.news` → `article.news` |
| Alias resolution | 24 | `blog_post` → `article.blog` |
| Parent type inference | 15 | `article` → `article.news` (from domain) |
| Fuzzy matching | 18 | `artcle.analyis` → `article.analysis` |
| Fallback classification | 6 | `custom.misc` → `reference.wiki` |
| **Total corrections** | **63** | — |

After normalization: **100% taxonomy conformance**.

## Token efficiency

SDF achieves a 99% token reduction from raw HTML:

| Representation | Avg. Size | Avg. Tokens | Reduction from HTML |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Raw HTML | 89 KB | ~73,000 | — |
| Markdown (cleaned) | 12 KB | ~4,200 | 94.2% |
| **SDF JSON** | **2 KB** | **~750** | **98.9%** |

Token efficiency from markdown to SDF is **46% reduction** — significant because many agent pipelines already convert HTML to markdown as a first step. SDF provides further compression by extracting only semantic content.

### Where tokens go in SDF

| Section | Avg. Tokens | % of Document |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| summary | 180 | 24% |
| entities | 120 | 16% |
| type_data | 150 | 20% |
| claims | 95 | 13% |
| relationships | 65 | 9% |
| source + provenance | 80 | 11% |
| Other fields | 60 | 8% |

## JSON validity

Across all 2,335 documents, **100% produced valid JSON**. This is achieved through:

1. Schema-constrained generation (the extraction model outputs against a JSON schema)
2. Post-generation validation with automatic repair for minor formatting issues
3. Retry logic for generation failures (< 0.5% of documents require retry)
